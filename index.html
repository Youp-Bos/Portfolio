        <h4 class="w3-margin-top">I am in my second year of programming at RocvA/BIT Academy
            as a software developer. From day one up until now I have been in love with the concept of
            writing a few lines of code to then see a website start to form from those pieces of code.
            I love to see myself grow in this field and to achieve something great.

                    <p>The Bit academy is an excellence track separate from the standert education. At the Bit academy you will be challenged more.
                        the Bit academy uses jarvis.
                        jarvis is a web application that ensures that you can go throug the assignments at your own pace.
                        while at the Bit academy we work with peer to peer learning this ensures that we can learn from our own mistakes and does of others.

                    <p>Roc Amstelveen Amstelland or better known as RocVa is a MBO
                        School, here I study Software Developer on a 3 year course.
                        During the first year I learnt basic stuff like how to build a flag using CSS,
                        but soon I started to get a bit bored of what they were teaching us.
                        But there were 2 excellence tracks: the Bit academy or a sped up Education.
                        After looking into both of these options I went whit the Bit academy
                        where I shall now finish my Education.

                    <p>During a 3 day visit to PWN drinkwaterproductiebedrijf Andijk
                        we and many more were challenged to think of a solution on howto make the work
                        at the water purification plant safer. We used augmented reality to guide new
                        and inexperienced engineers in real time. As a team, we mapped out the entire plant
                        in a 3D space so that everything important was clearly marked.
